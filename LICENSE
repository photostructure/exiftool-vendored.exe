Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1.  Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
    protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related
    Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the
    following:

        the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
        and translate a Work; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
        performer(s); publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
        likeness depicted in a Work; rights protecting against unfair competition in
        regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
        rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
        Work; database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
        European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
        protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
        including any amended or successor version of such directive); and other
        similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on
        applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2.  Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
    applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
    unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
    Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
    unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
    the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
    provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
    in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
    purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
    promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit
    of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs
    and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
    revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
    equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as
    contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3.  Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
    judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
    shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
    Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
    is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
    transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
    license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
    all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
    law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
    medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
    including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes
    (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
    applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason
    be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial
    invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
    and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise
    any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
    assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in
    either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4.  Limitations and Disclaimers.

    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document. Affirmer
    offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
    concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
    without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
    or other rights required for any use of the Work. Affirmer understands and
    acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has
    no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

The Artistic License

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package
may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of
artistic control over the development of the package, while giving the users of
the package the right to use and distribute the Package in a more-or-less
customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.

Definitions:

- "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright
  Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created through
  textual modification.
- "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified,
  or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of the Copyright
  Holder.
- "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for
  the package.
- "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package.
- "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media
  cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will
  not be required to justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the
  computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.)
- "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though
  there may be fees involved in handling the item. It also means that
  recipients of the item may redistribute it under the same conditions they
  received it.

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
   Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
   duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived
   from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such
   a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that
   you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and when you
   changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with
standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a separate
manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly documents how it
differs from the Standard Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable
   form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
get the Standard Version.

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package
with your modifications.

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard
Version executables, giving the non-standard executables non-standard
names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages (or
equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
Version.

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
   Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You
   may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute this
   Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a
   larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not
   advertise this Package as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
   from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the copyright
   of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may be sold
   commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.

7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not
   be considered part of this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
   products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
   WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
